# Skills I Picked Up

## Mechanical Design

Mechanical Design refers to designing the mechanism and the more physical aspect of the robots. For example, I learnt how to prototype our robot parts by 3D Modelling them using CAD (computer-aided design) software.

I also learnt how to use the 3D printer that my CCA's seniors pooled money together to purchase

Some of the tools I use for mechanical design, robot assembly etc.

## Electrical Design

Electrical design refers to the designing of custom PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) using design software like Autodesk EAGLE. This allows us to design custom circuits that fits our robot. I believe that this is an important skill and is very useful. I also get to learn about how electrical components work.

Fig. 3.2.5 and 3.2.6 shows one of the many PCB designs from 2021 - 2022's RoboCup Lightweight Competition
