## What do we do in Robotics?

### Participating in competitions

In the Robotics CCA, we sign up for competitions (usually the same ones each year) and build robots that fit the competition criteria to compete against other schools in Singapore, sometimes even against international opponents.

## Commitment

My CCA requires a lot of commitment as it is a completely student-run CCA with no external vendors or trainers teaching us. We usually learn most things online and thus we require a lot more time.

Sometimes, I find myself going back to the Robotics Lab every day of the week and even on weekends and holidays to work on my robot, especially when it's nearing the competition season.

Hence for me, time management is incredibly important as I have to handle my academics and CCA at the same time.
