# Accomplishments

## What am I really proud of?

### Exams

I scored an A1 on my Mathematics, Physics, Computing and History CTs in Term 2.

### Good time management

I am glad that I have been able to manage my time properly, balancing schoolwork, CCA and other commitments well, such that I can hand in my work on time.&#x20;

This was especially hard for me due to the amount of commitment required for my CCA. I would usually stay back after school to attend CCA sessions 4 out 5 days of the week, even returning to school on the weekends sometimes. During last year's December holidays, I went back to school almost every day to work on my robot as it was nearing competition season.

Furthermore, I have many friends who come to me for help, usually for Council or CMC work as I have experience in graphic design, video editing etc.
