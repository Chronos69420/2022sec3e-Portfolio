# Accomplishments

## What am I really proud of?

### Exams and tests

I scored an A1 on my Mathematics, Physics, Computing and History CTs in Term 2.

### Good time management

I am glad that I have been able to manage my time properly, balancing schoolwork, CCA and other commitments well, such that I can hand in my work on time.&#x20;

This was especially hard for me due to the amount of commitment required for my CCA. I would usually stay back after school to attend CCA sessions 4 out 5 days of the week, even returning to school on the weekends sometimes. During last year's December holidays, I went back to school almost every day to work on my robot as it was nearing competition season.

### Helping others with my skills and representing my class

Furthermore, I have many friends who come to me for help, usually for Council or CMC work as I have experience in [graphic design](../student-initiated-learning/graphic-design.md), [video editing](../student-initiated-learning/video-editing.md) etc.

Recently, I just helped my classmates and CMC edit a video for the Appreciation Day Skit.

On top of helping others, I can also gain experience, learn and become more proficient.
