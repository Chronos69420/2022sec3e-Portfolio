# Getting There

## **How have I shown significant progress in my academic learning?**

### Progress in some subjects

I'm weaker in the languages, especially in subjects like English, History and Geography (Sec 2) and Chinese. However, I've seen myself make some significant progress so far.

### **Something that surprised me**

For example, I usually don't do particularly well in subjects like History and Geography as seen in Sec 2. Yet, I managed to get A1 for Term 2's History Common Test which I am really proud of.

## Aspects I am still trying to master

### Weaker subjects

I still haven't been able to make much progress in subjects such as English and Social Studies, but I see myself improving down the year. I've set myself a goal to achieve at least A2 for English and A1 for Social Studies.

For Chinese, I also have some lacklustre aspects, especially Chinese Composition and Oral.

### Rude shock

I didn't expect myself to do poorly in this time's Chemistry Common Test. Though most of it was careless mistakes and misconceptions, I will still strive to do better in the next test and not let my guard down.

I plan to achieve this by taking down notes, asking more questions and revising harder before the test.
