# Talent Programme

## Computing Talent Programme (CTP)

### Why did I choose this programme?

I was interested in coding and programming since young and I felt that joining the CTP could give me many opportunities to develop my passion and interest. In Sec 1, I did a Cat 9: Infocomm project without any prior knowledge, but since it was in my field of interest, I went with it anyway. In the end, the project turned out pretty lacklustre.

However, I did not stop there and wanted to continue pursuing my passion. I heard of the CTP and the experiences that I could gain from it. It was also stated that not much prior knowledge was needed, so I had to grasp this chance.

The CTP also assisted me in my Cat 9: Infocomm Project Work this year, as there were many exclusive training sessions and courses for the CTP students.

This could also assist me in my CCA, which is Robotics, as many skills I can learn from the CTP are also very useful for my CCA.
