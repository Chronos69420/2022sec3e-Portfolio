# Things I Can Learn

## User interface & experience design (UIUX Design)

UIUX Design refers to the creation and optimisation of a user interface in order to achieve the best and smoothest user experience. I get to learn how to use prototyping tools like Figma.

This preview below is made completely from scratch using Figma. It is used as a prototype or preview of the actual webpage for our project work final profuct.

## Web development

This refers to the building of websites using code, which is an incredibly useful skill. Even this portfolio you are viewing right now is built this way.

## Back-end development (involving crypto.)

For my project, our group is making use of development tools like Moralis API and Ganache. Just think of it as tools made for developers working with cryptocurrency and the Blockchain network.
