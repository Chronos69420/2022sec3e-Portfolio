# Project Idea Summary

My group is aiming to create a decentralised application (dApp) called **BlockVault**, which allows users to store their personal files and important documents on the Blockchain network.

Users can upload files of any format (IPFS), and an encryptor will encrypt the file and store it on the Blockchain network (Pinata).

This file is securely encrypted on the Blockchain network, and it would be near impossible for hackers to access and steal the data.&#x20;

On the other hand, when the user wants to access the file and data, a decrypter will convert the hash back into the file.

To put it simply, it's sort of a decentralised Google Drive, where users can store files safely without the need for a centralised server.
