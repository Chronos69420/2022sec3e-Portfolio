# Introduction

## Hello!

Hello, I am Zhu Yunsong, a Year 3 student from Hwa Chong Institution. My class from 2020 to 2022 are 1i2, 2i2 and 3a3 respectively.&#x20;

### Place of birth

Unlike many others, I am not from Singapore. I was born in Guangzhou, Guangdong Province, China. My parents were the first generation in my family to migrate to Singapore, and I came to Singapore when I was the age of 1.

### Interests

I wouldn't say I am the most athletic person as I am more interested in tech and computer-related stuff, like robotics, coding, graphic design, video editing etc.
