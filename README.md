# Introduction

## Hello!

Hello, I am Zhu Yunsong, a Year 3 student from Hwa Chong Institution. My class is 3A3 this year.

### Interests

I wouldn't say I am the most athletic person as I am more interested in tech and computer-related stuff, like robotics, coding, graphic design, video editing etc.
