# Graphic Design

## What is graphic design?

> Graphic design is the profession and academic discipline whose activity consists in projecting visual communications intended to transmit specific messages to social groups, with specific objectives.

## How did I start?

I got into graphic design when I was in Secondary 1, when I was designing a thumbnail for my friend. When I searched for tutorials on how to do it, I was awed by all the beautiful designs others could do and was eager to learn how to make something similar.

I started by learning how to use Adobe Photoshop, and I learnt independently by finding tutorials online. I also realised how useful this was for school and in the future. I learnt how to make logos, posters, T-Shirt designs etc.

## Tools I learnt how to use

Keep in mind that everything I've mentioned so far was self-taught using tutorials and research online. Part of learning was also exploring on my own to see what I can make, and this was what I found joy in.

### Adobe Photoshop

Other than Photoshop, I also learnt how to use many other design tools that were a better fit for the result I was trying to achieve.

### Adobe Illustrator

Another tool I used was Adobe Illustrator, which was better for drawing logos and flat-coloured shapes.

### Figma

Lastly, for designing webpages, applications, software and UI (User Interface) prototypes, I learnt how to use Figma.

Figma was also particularly useful for my [project work](broken-reference) for making prototypes.

## Benefits of learning graphic design

### In school

Having such a skill enabled me to help my class and even the school design and create things.

#### Class T-shirts

I have designed multiple T-shirts for my class over the years.
