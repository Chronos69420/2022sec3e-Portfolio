# Video Editing

## How did I start?

I started video editing in Secondary 1, when I was trying to make a YouTube video. Instead of using all the simple video editing tools people normally use like iMove, Kinemaster etc, I wanted to learn how to use more complex video editors to make my videos better.

## Tools I learn to use

I learnt how to use these apps through watching hours of YouTube tutorials and reading video editing forums.

### Adobe Premiere Pro

Premiere Pro is the main video editing tool that I use today, as it is made for professionals and thus is packed with many useful functions and effects.
